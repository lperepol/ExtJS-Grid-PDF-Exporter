**Dependencies to compile**

* Sencha Exporter is currently part of Ext JS Premium and needs to be installed in the workspace/packages folder


**Wait, I just want to see how this app looks without compiling**

* Run it directly from github [here](https://rawgit.com/shikhirsingh/ExtJS-Grid-PDF-Exporter/master/build/index.html)


**Steps to install and run this application**


1. Ensure your Sencha Cmd version installed is greater than 6.1.2+
2. Ensure that the exporter plugin is installed in your [workspace](http://docs.sencha.com/cmd/6.x/workspaces.html)/packages/local/exporter directory.
3. Generate a new project via: sencha -sdk /path/to/ext6 generate app GridExportPdf [workspace](http://docs.sencha.com/cmd/6.x/workspaces.html)/GridExportPdf
4. Copy the content of the src folder in this report to the newly created project
5. Run the following command in the directory of this application: sencha app watch
6. Load the page in your browser: http://localhost:1841/GridExportPdf


**Troubleshooting Tips**

* Make sure your are placing the correct directory into your Sencha Cmd workspace. You need to put in just the src directory
* Ensure your workspace/ext directory is running Ext JS 6.x (not earlier build)
* Make sure you have installed the Sencha Exporter package. Currently it is bundled with Ext JS Pivot Grid addons, although Pivot grid is not a dependency
* I've not been able to maintain this release(I no longer work at Sencha) and have accepted a couple of pull requests without doing a proper code review. Please look at the "Release" marked 1.0 as it was the last well tested version
